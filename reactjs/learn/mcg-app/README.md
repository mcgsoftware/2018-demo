# Starting stopping server

## To Start: 

Default is port 3000, but override that by setting PORT env variable. 

```
 export PORT=3001
 npm start
```

To stop
-------
```
 npm stop
```

# To Install: 

This also uses fetch api, not sure if that is already present or needs to be installed?

```
$ npx create react app (see reactjs site for example)
$ npm install --save prop-types  // for PropTypes
$ npm install --save axios
```
